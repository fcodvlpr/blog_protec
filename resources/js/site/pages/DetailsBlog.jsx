          <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
          <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
          <blockquote className="blockquote">
            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>

          <h3>Example lists</h3>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
        </article>
        </Col>
        <Col md={4}>
          <RecentBlogs />
